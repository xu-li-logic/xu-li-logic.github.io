  abstract = {We introduce a logic of knowledge in a framework in which knowledge is treated as a kind of belief. The framework is based on a standard KD45 characterization of belief, and the characterization of knowledge undergoes the classical tripartite analysis that knowledge is justified true belief, which has a natural link to the studies of logics of evidence and justification. The interpretation of knowledge avoids the unwanted properties of logical omniscience, independent of the choice of the base logic of belief. We axiomatize the logic, prove its soundness and completeness and study the computational complexity results of the model checking and satisfiability problems. We extend the logic to a multi-agent setting and introduce a variant in which belief is characterized in a weaker system to avoid the problem of logical omniscience.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we introduce and study seven types of semantics for bipolar argumentation frameworks, each extending Dung's interpretation of attack with a distinct interpretation of support. First, we introduce three types of defence-based semantics by adapting the notions of defence. Second, we examine two types of selection-based semantics that select extensions by counting the number of supports. Third, we analyse two types of traditional reduction-based semantics under deductive and necessary interpretations of support. We provide full analysis of twenty-eight bipolar argumentation semantics and ten principles.},

The framework has its applications in epistemic logic for reasoning about agents' knowledge based on their capability, and in deontic logic for agents' choices based on their deontic capability or utilities. We make use of weighted Kripke models with the weights understood epistemically as a similarity measure between states and deontically as a measure of expected utilities. We present sound and complete axiomatizations for the logics, and discuss variants and possible extensions.},
